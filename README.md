# Numerical Methods for Computer Science Codes

This repository contains exercises and practice C++ code for the Numerical Methods for Computer Science (NumCS) course.

## Disclaimer

Most of the code was provided as templates, with sections marked by `TODO:` that I had to complete. My contributions are primarily focused on those portions of the code. 

The file `playground.cpp`, however, is entirely my own work, created as additional practice.
